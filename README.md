# Bloomstead Garden Simulator - C++

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the C++ language.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

Bloomstead is a terminal based garden simulation game developed in C++. In this game, players manage a small garden where they can plant seeds, water plants, deal with pests and weeds, and harvest mature plants. The purpose of this project is to deepen my understanding of object-oriented programming in C++, including class inheritance, memory management with pointers, encapsulation, and game state logic.
